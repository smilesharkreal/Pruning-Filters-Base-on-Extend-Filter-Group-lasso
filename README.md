1. the concept fig of  "EFG"(extend filter group):

 left is CNN, the right is ResNet
2. we choose three datasets, cifar10,cifar100 and caltech101ï¼Œand our method with the similar work:

3. as for all of filters in CNN , our methods with standard CNN , the value is more less,  the icon is more black.

4. the comparison of our method with other methods, we choose two CNN , the linear CNN :VGG ,and the ResNet:
